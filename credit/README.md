# CREDIT and Luhn's Algorithm for credit card validation

This project is part of the Harvard's CS50 course for introduction to computer science and programming; homework for the "*week 1*", where we learned about C programming language.
This project took me a couple of hours, and it was pretty challenging for me, but at the end, I was able to create a good algorithm to solve the problem.

## Learnings

This is my second C program finished and with a clear purpose. I learned several things about C programming language, as well as other things such as the Luhn's algorithm and how it works.

- **C learnings**
    1. How to use strings in C.
    2. Better understanding of functions.
        - I discover that C doesn´t allow you to have functions inside functions.
    3. Better understanding of the syntax.
- **Other learnings**
    1. Luhn's algorithm.

## Resources and references

This are the all the resources used to develop my learnings.
