# README FILE

## What is this repository?

This are my beginner projects that I'm working on in order to learn HTML, CSS, JavaSCript, Node.js, etc; and some useful frameworks such as Sass, Bootstrap, an so on.

Here is the list of projects that I've made up to now:

1. Background colors
2. Random quote generator

## Temporary files

I also have other folders that are just temporary. I use them to learn particular concepts such as asynchrony and synchrony, requests, and code statements that I donÂ´t know yet. You will se that these folders will appear suddenly and later then will be eliminated.

The goal of this repository is to keep track of my learning.
