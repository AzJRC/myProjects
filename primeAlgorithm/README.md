# Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm

In this project, I build my first C program for first time. I'm learning from the CS50 course that the university of Harvard is sharing to everyone online.
This code took me a time to do it, and I needed to study a little bit about the algorithm that Eratosthenes once develop in order to translate it to code language.

## Learnings

The most important learning is C. This was my first approach to the language, and I felt it too difficult. Is has nothing to do with another languages like Python or JavaScript; very strict and limiting.
However, it help me to understand much better some elemental terms such as memory, the syntax, and how the computer performs all its calculation under the hood.
Besides, another learning that I got, more related with the mathematical field, was the explanation of the algorithm that Eratosthenes once though. While researching, I discover that there is another algorithm called Miller-Rabin method, though, I didn't understand that one.

- **C learnings**
    1. I learn that C is a programming language built for Linux OS.
    2. Because I'm working in a Windows OS, I needed to install MingW64 to have the required compilers.
    3. Syntax for C is very strict. Every semicolon is important after each statement.
